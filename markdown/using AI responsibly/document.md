If you aren’t sure about the accuracy of a model’s output, experiment with a range of prompts to learn how the model performs. Crafting clear and concise prompts will improve the relevance and utility of the outputs you receive. Taking a proactive approach to addressing and reducing instances of unexpected or inaccurate results is also best practice. </p><p>Remember that, in general, you’ll only get good output if you provide good input. To help you create good input, consider using this framework when crafting prompts:</p><p>- Describe your **task**, specifying a persona and format preference.</p><p>- Include any **context** the generative AI tool might need to give you what you want.</p><p>- Add **references** the generative AI tool can use to inform its output.</p><p>- **Evaluate** the output to identify opportunities for improvement. </p><p>- **Iterate** on your initial prompt to attain those improvements.</p><p>After you’ve used that framework to create your prompts, review your output. Fact-check all content the AI tool generated by cross-referencing the information with reliable sources. To do this, you can:</p><p>- Look for sources using a search engine.</p><p>- Prompt the AI to provide references so that you can determine where it might’ve gotten the information.</p><p>- If possible, ask an expert to confirm whether the output is true.</p>|

Here are some actions you can take to be transparent about using AI: </p><p>- Tell your audience and anyone it might affect that you’ve used or are using AI. This step is particularly important when using AI in high-impact professional settings, where there are risks involved in the outcome of AI. </p><p>- Explain what type of tool you used, describe your intention, provide an overview of your use of AI, and offer any other information that could help your audience evaluate potential risks.</p><p>- Don’t copy and paste outputs generated by AI and pass them off as your own.</p>|

This is especially important because, in some cases, you may not be aware that you’re engaging with AI. </p><p>Here are some actions you can take to evaluate image, text, or video content before you share it:</p><p>- Fact check content accuracy using search engines. </p><p>- Ask yourself: If this content turns out to be inaccurate or untrue, am I willing or able to correct my mistake? If you aren’t, that’s probably an indicator that you shouldn’t share it. </p><p>- Remember the steps to SHARE, the[ ](https://www.who.int/news/item/22-09-2021-be-careful-what-you-share.-things-aren-t-always-what-they-seem-online/)[ World Health OrganizationOpens in a new tab ](https://www.who.int/news/item/22-09-2021-be-careful-what-you-share.-things-aren-t-always-what-they-seem-online/)’s mnemonic that can help people be more thoughtful when sharing information online. </p><p>&emsp;- **Source** your content from credible and official sources.</p><p>&emsp;- **Headlines** don't always tell the full story, so read full articles before you share.</p><p>&emsp;- **Analyze** the facts presented to determine everything you're reading is true.</p><p>&emsp;- **Retouched** photos and videos might be present in the content you want to share, so be cautious about misleading imagery.</p><p>&emsp;- **Errors** may be present in the content you're sharing and the information is more likely to be false if it’s riddled with typos and errors.</p>|

Here are some actions you can take to consider those privacy and security implications:</p><p>- Only input essential information. Don’t provide any information that’s unnecessary, confidential, or private, because you may threaten the security of a person or the organization you’re working for. </p><p>- Read supporting documents associated with the tools you’re using. Any documentation that describes how the model was trained to use privacy safeguards (such as terms and conditions) can be a helpful resource for you.</p>|

Keep that in mind as you use various tools and models, and use your best judgment to use AI for good. Before you use AI, ask yourself:</p><p>- If I use AI for this particular task, will it hurt anyone around me? </p><p>- Does it reinforce or uphold biases that may cause damage to any groups of people?</p>|
